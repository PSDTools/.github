**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what are we all about?

We were founded in 2022, and began working full-steam-ahead in 2023.
We're comprised of 2 students at the moment and are _very_ enthusiastic.

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can you get involved?

Come and help!
We're looking for maintainers, preferably from Pattonville, who want to learn about technology.

## 👩‍💻 Useful resources - Is there anything else you should know?
